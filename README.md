## Overview
The main goal of the project is to implement several number system conversion methods, including binary to decimal, decimal to binary, octal to binary, binary to octal, and binary to hexadecimal conversions. 
The program takes user input and can handle a variety of input values, including floating point and negative numbers. The user enters the number they want to convert, the base of the number entered, and the base they want to convert to. The program then displays the converted number, ensuring that the conversion is accurate and can be performed correctly.
